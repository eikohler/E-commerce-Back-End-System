# E-commerce Back End System
- I was tasked with creating a back end e-commerce database platform using the ORM sequelize to structure the 
db.
- The challenge was making sure all each table in the db was structured properly and had the correct associations between the tables
- Furthermore, I had to refine/complete the CRUD api route calls for the products, tags and categories
- The Categories can have many products but the products can only belong to one category
- The Products can belong to many tags and the tags can belong to many products -> connected throught the ProductTag model
